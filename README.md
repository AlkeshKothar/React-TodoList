 # React - TodoList
(Please wait for screenshots to load thank you :) )

## Concepts and Learning

A React Todo-List that allows you to add Task, Edit and Mark it done, along with moving it up and down and positioning it. <br>
I have use useStates to manage multiple states, useEffect, customer styling and Bootstap 5 as it was a learning project rather that React Bootstrap.

### This Project is build using : <br>

React
Bootstrap 5 <br>
